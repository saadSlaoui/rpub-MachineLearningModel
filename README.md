# rpub-MachineLearningModel

I have used data visualization and machine learning techniques in order to predict student performance using multidimensional analysis. The research project is available online as an rpub document written in Markdowm. It focuses on classification models, including decision trees and SVMs. The visualizations are made using both R's base tools and the ggplot2 package.
